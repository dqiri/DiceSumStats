# DiceSumStats
## DiceSumStatistics or in other words, the number of possible ways per possible sum of multiple dice

This tool can be used to see how many ways you can combine dice together to sum up to a particular number.
Consider the classic 2d6 problem.
One could use a chart to show the combination of the first dice with the second dice.

For example
```
\| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| <- first dice
--------------------
1| 2  3  4  5  6  7 <
2| 3  4  5  6  7  8 <
3| 4  5  6  7  8  9 <-their sum
4| 5  6  7  8  9 10 <
5| 6  7  8  9 10 11 <
6| 7  8  9 10 11 12 <
^-2nd dice
```
And then you can manually see each sum, and then add up every occurence.

But then what about a 3rd dice?
A 3D chart?
But then what about a 4th dice?
A 4D chart??
But then what about a 5th dice?
